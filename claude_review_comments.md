/# Code Review — blackbox (ES 1.7 → 9.x migration)

## Resolved on `blackbox-elasticsearch-upgrade`

- **Naturen filter crash** (not in original review) — `NaturenSearchBuilder.constructSearchRequest()` triggered `IllegalStateException: Object builders can only be used once` because the parent (`MarcusSearchBuilder`) consumed the `BoolQuery.Builder` from `getFilter()`, then Naturen built it again. Fixed by changing `AbstractSearchBuilder` to store filter/postFilter as built `BoolQuery` instead of `BoolQuery.Builder` (immutable, reusable). Servlet pre-builds before passing to the builder.
- **Items 1, 10, 12, 16** — `SkaSearchBuilder`, `ServiceName.SKA`, and `SearchBuilderFactory.skaSearch()` deleted. Confirmed unreachable: both legacy and new SKA frontends omit the `service=` parameter (verified with live URL on `ska-katalog.bgo1.test.rail.uib.no`), so requests fall through to `MarcusSearchBuilder`.

---

## Round 2 review (second pass over the full branch diff)

### Fixed in this pass

- **`FilterUtils.buildBoolFilter` no longer swallows exceptions** — the migration had dropped the `throw`, so a half-built filter would silently return *unfiltered* results. Restored the rethrow.
- **Malformed `aggs` now returns 400 JSON** — `SearchServlet` validates `aggs` up front (`AggregationUtils.validateAggregations`) and writes a `{"error": ...}` 400 body. Previously a bad `aggs` was handled inconsistently (swallowed in the filter path, 500 + HTML in the agg path). `validateAggregations`/`addAggregations` now throw `IllegalParameterException` (not a raw `RuntimeException`) on parse failure. `contains()` is unchanged (still throws), so `AggregationUtilsTest.testContains04` stays valid — malformed input is now rejected before any filter/agg path runs.
- **`AggregationUtils.addAggregations(req, aggs)` null-guard** — the single-arg overload passed `null` selectedFacets straight into `getPostFilter(@NotNull ...)` → NPE. Now defaults to `Collections.emptyMap()`.
- **CLAUDE.md SKA mismatch** — the committed CLAUDE.md still documented a `SKA` service / `SkaSearchBuilder` that this branch deletes. Removed those references (service table, routing block, builder section, key-files list) and added a one-line note that SKA always fell through to `MarcusSearchBuilder`.
- **Minor cleanups** — `JsonFileLoader.loadFromStream` now uses try-with-resources + a shared `ObjectMapper` (was leaking the reader and newing a mapper per call); `AbstractSearchBuilder.toString()` null-safe on `getIndices()`; `WabSearchBuilder` `count(100_000)` instead of `Integer.parseInt("100000")` and dropped the expensive string-concat `logger.fine` artifacts; removed `CompletionSuggestion.main()` debug entry point and its now-unused imports; replaced the dangling WIP comment in `SearchServlet`; moved the `settings-loader-test.json` fixture to `src/test/resources` and tidied `SettingsLoaderTest`; added trailing newlines to `Dockerfile`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ElasticsearchClientFactory.java`, `ApplicationShutdownListener.java`, `config.template.example.json`.
  - Deleted by user: `src/main/resources/settings-loader-test.json` and stray copy.

### Reviewed and deliberately left unchanged

- **Random-picture boost override (`MarcusSearchBuilder`)** — the trailing `.functions(List.of(fotoFs))` still overwrites the empty-query branch's `[fotoFs, randomFs]`. **Left as-is by decision:** the frontend behaves correctly (a random photo is returned and changes between refreshes), so the empty-query boost is working in practice. No change.
- **OR sub-aggregation filter only applied to selected facets** — the `else` branch that applied `aggs_filter` to *unselected* OR facets was dropped, and sort-by-sub-aggregation is no longer used. Counts for unselected OR-facet values won't account for sibling OR selections. **Skipped by decision.**
- **`date_histogram` always uses `fixedInterval`** — calendar units (`year`/`month`/`quarter`/`week`) would be rejected by ES. **Left:** date aggregations are currently correct in the live frontends, so no calendar intervals are in use.
- **`SortUtils`** — bare `sort=_score` (no colon) now returns `null` (no sort) instead of a score sort, and an invalid order throws `IllegalParameterException` during builder construction (before the servlet's JSON error handling), surfacing as a 500/HTML rather than 400. **Skipped.**
- **`closeClient()` double-closes the transport** (`_transport().close()` then `client.close()`). Harmless (second close is caught). **Skipped.**
- **Required-but-unused env vars** — `ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_NAME`/`NODE_NAME` are mandatory but unused by `createElasticsearchClient` (only host/port/api_key used); REST scheme is hardcoded `https`. **Skipped.**
- **File-based config crashes at startup** — `config.template.example.json` has no `api_key` and uses port `9300`; `getValueAsString(properties,"api_key")` NPEs in file mode. **Skipped** (file mode is slated for removal).
- **`addDateRangeFilter` semantics** — the rewrite now wraps the date sub-queries in a nested `bool.should(...)` added as a `must`, making the date range *required* (previously, mixed with facet `must` clauses, the `should` date clauses were effectively optional). Likely a fix; dates verified OK in the frontend. No change — noted for awareness.

## Bug — `SkaSearchBuilder` filter is silently ignored

**Note: `SkaSearchBuilder` appears to be dormant in production.** The SKA frontend no longer passes `service=ska`, so requests fall through to the default `MarcusSearchBuilder` which handles filters correctly. Verified against live URLs — no `service=` parameter is present. The bug is still latent code and should be fixed or the class removed.

`SkaSearchBuilder.java:58-61` — When a filter is set, the TODO comment blocks its application and the `else` branch (which sets the query) is also skipped. If `SkaSearchBuilder` were ever invoked with AND-type facets active, it would return unfiltered results:

```java
if (getFilter() != null) {
   //@todo searchRequest.query(...); // ← nothing happens here
} else {
    searchRequest.query(query); // ← also skipped when filter exists
}
```

The fix mirrors how `WabSearchBuilder` and `NaturenSearchBuilder` handle this — wrap query + filter in a bool:

```java
if (getFilter() != null) {
    BoolQuery filterQuery = getFilter().build();
    searchRequest.query(QueryBuilders.bool().must(query)
        .filter(List.of(filterQuery._toQuery())).build()._toQuery());
} else {
    searchRequest.query(query);
}
```

---

## Bug — `MarcusSearchBuilder` random-picture boost is overridden

`MarcusSearchBuilder.java:103-106` — In the no-query branch, `functionScoreQueryBuilder` is built with `[fotoFs, randomFs]`. But line 106 then calls `.functions(List.of(fotoFs))` on the same builder, replacing the function list with only `fotoFs`. The random picture boost is never applied.

```java
// no-query branch sets both functions:
functionScoreQueryBuilder = QueryBuilders.functionScore()...functions(List.of(fotoFs, randomBoost));
// ...then immediately overwrites with only fotoFs:
query = functionScoreQueryBuilder.functions(List.of(fotoFs)).build()._toQuery();
```

For the with-query branch, `fotoFs` should be the only function score, so line 106 is correct there. The fix is to apply `fotoFs` inside each branch rather than unconditionally after:

```java
if (StringUtils.hasText(getQueryString())) {
    query = QueryBuilders.functionScore()
        .query(QueryUtils.buildMarcusQueryString(getQueryString()).build()._toQuery())
        .functions(List.of(fotoFs)).build()._toQuery();
} else {
    String randomQueryString = randomPictures[ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(randomPictures.length)];
    query = QueryBuilders.functionScore()
        .query(QueryBuilders.matchAll().build()._toQuery())
        .functions(List.of(fotoFs, new FunctionScore.Builder()
            .filter(QueryBuilders.simpleQueryString().query(randomQueryString).build()._toQuery())
            .weight(2.0).build()))
        .build()._toQuery();
}
```

---

## Critical — `config.template.json` missing `api_key` — startup crash for file-based config

`ElasticsearchClientFactory.java:50-51` — `createElasticsearchClient` always reads `api_key` from the properties map:

```java
new BasicHeader("Authorization", "ApiKey " + BlackboxUtils.getValueAsString(properties, "api_key"))
```

`getValueAsString` throws `NullPointerException` if the key is absent. The file-based config (`config.template.json`, `config.template.example.json`) has neither `api_key` nor the correct REST port (they still show port `9300`, the old transport port; the REST port is `9200` or `443`). Any deployment not using the `ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_NAME` env var will crash at startup.

Add `api_key` to the config template and update the port:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "name": "...",
    "host": "...",
    "port": "9200",
    "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

---

## Critical — `fixedInterval` used for calendar-type intervals in date histogram aggregations

`AggregationUtils.java:224` — ES 8+ strictly separates fixed intervals (`1d`, `7d`, expressed in time units) from calendar intervals (`year`, `month`, `quarter`, `week`). The old `DateHistogram.Interval` handled both. The new code always calls `fixedInterval`:

```java
dateHistBuilder.fixedInterval(new Time.Builder().time(facet.path("interval").asText()).build());
```

If any aggregation config passes `"interval": "year"` or `"interval": "month"`, Elasticsearch rejects the request with a parse error. If calendar intervals are in use, they need to be routed to `calendarInterval` instead:

```java
if (facet.has("interval")) {
    String interval = facet.path("interval").asText();
    try {
        dateHistBuilder.calendarInterval(CalendarInterval._DESERIALIZER.parse(interval));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        dateHistBuilder.fixedInterval(new Time.Builder().time(interval).build());
    }
}
```

---

## Medium — No error JSON body on exceptions in `SearchServlet`

`SearchServlet.java:161-171` — Both catch blocks re-throw the exception, which means Tomcat produces an HTML error page while `Content-Type` is already set to `application/json`. Callers expecting JSON get an HTML response on errors. Set a 500 status and write a JSON error body before re-throwing (or instead of re-throwing), as already done in `doPost`.

---

## Medium — `closeClient()` closes the transport twice

`ElasticsearchClientFactory.java:124-128`:

```java
elasticsearchClient._transport().close();  // closes transport
elasticsearchClient.close();               // also closes transport internally
```

`ElasticsearchClient.close()` already closes the underlying transport. The explicit `_transport().close()` is redundant and may log an error or throw on the second close. Remove the first line.

---

## Medium — `FilterUtils.getPostFilter(@NotNull)` called with null selectedFacets

`AggregationUtils.java:147` — The single-argument overload of `addAggregations` delegates with `null`:

```java
return addAggregations(searchRequest, aggregations, null);
```

The three-argument overload immediately calls `FilterUtils.getPostFilter(selectedFacets, aggregations)`, which is annotated `@NotNull` but receives `null`. Inside `buildBoolFilter`, iterating `filterMap.entrySet()` throws `NullPointerException`.

Safe in the Servlet path (always supplies an empty map), but will crash any test or library consumer calling `addAggregations` without selected facets. Add a null guard:

```java
BoolQuery.Builder aggsFilter = FilterUtils.getPostFilter(
    selectedFacets != null ? selectedFacets : Collections.emptyMap(), aggregations);
```

---

## Medium — OR-aggregation sub-filter not applied to unselected facets

`AggregationUtils.java:161-183` — The old code applied sub-aggregation filters to all OR-type facets (both those with active selections and those without), so that facet counts for unselected values were accurate when sibling OR facets had active selections. The new code only adds sub-filters when `selectedFacets.containsKey(facetField)`, leaving unselected OR facets without a sub-filter. If you use multi-select OR facets, the counts for unselected values in those facets will not account for selections made in sibling OR facets.

---

## Minor — `WabSearchBuilder:22` — parsing a string literal as int

```java
private final TrackHits trackHits = new TrackHits.Builder().count(Integer.parseInt("100000")).build();
```

Should be `.count(100000)`.

---

## Minor — `SkaSearchBuilder` — empty `finally` block

`SkaSearchBuilder.java:87-89` — The empty `finally {}` serves no purpose and should be removed.

---

## Minor — `AbstractSearchBuilder.toString():333` — NPE if indices are null

```java
getIndices().length == 0  // throws NullPointerException if getIndices() returns null
```

`getIndices()` can return null (field defaults to null, `setIndices` may never be called). Should be:

```java
getIndices() == null || getIndices().length == 0 ? "" : Arrays.toString(getIndices())
```

---

## Minor — `SkaSearchBuilder.BoostType.INTERVJU` is defined but never used

`SkaSearchBuilder.java:95` — `INTERVJU = "intervju"` is declared but the boost logic at line 54 calls `weight(2.0)` with no filter referencing it, boosting all documents equally (a no-op scaling). Either wire it into the boost function as a filter (matching `NaturenSearchBuilder`'s pattern with `BoostType.ISSUE`), or remove the constant.

---

## Minor — `CompletionSuggestion.main()` in production code

`CompletionSuggestion.java:93-99` — A `public static void main()` method in a production class is a leftover debug tool. It would fail at runtime if called (no live client configured) and clutters the public API. Move any manual testing to a proper test class.

---

## Minor — Unused imports in `ElasticsearchClientFactory`

`ElasticsearchClientFactory.java:22-23` — `java.net.InetAddress` and `java.net.UnknownHostException` are imported but unused. `HttpHost` does not throw `UnknownHostException`; the catch block is dead. Remove both imports and the catch block.

---

## Minor — Obsolete `-Djava.endorsed.dirs` compiler arg

`pom.xml:122` — The endorsed standards mechanism was removed in Java 9 and is a no-op in Java 21. Remove the `<compilerArgs>` block and the `maven-dependency-plugin` execution that copies the jakartaee jar to the endorsed directory:

```xml
<!-- remove these -->
<compilerArgs>
    <arg>-Djava.endorsed.dirs=${endorsed.dir}</arg>
</compilerArgs>
```

---

## Cleanup — Dangling WIP comment in `SearchServlet`

`SearchServlet.java:152-153`:

```java
// Are there things added other than indicies lost between the translation of low level
// and the new rest client?
```

This is a debugging question, not documentation. Remove it. (The hybrid client approach — build via high-level client, execute via low-level REST client — is intentional and worth a proper explanation comment instead.)

---

## Cleanup — Missing newline at end of `docker/Dockerfile`

The diff shows `\ No newline at end of file`. Add a trailing newline.

---

## Cleanup — Dead code candidates

- `QueryUtils.toJsonString()` — builds a JSON string from a `SearchResponse`, but `SearchServlet` now serializes via the low-level REST response directly. Verify nothing calls this; if confirmed unused, remove it.
- `BlackboxUtils.jsonify()` — converts single-element arrays in a map; nothing in the current codebase appears to call it.

---

## Cleanup — `WabSearchBuilder` noisy debug logging

`WabSearchBuilder.java:70-72` — These lines compare filter sizes and equality for no apparent purpose:

```java
logger.fine("compare if filterQuery list is the same as filter() method" + ...);
logger.fine("sizes: " + filterQuery.filter().size() + ...);
```

Debugging artifacts. Remove them or consolidate into a single meaningful log line.

---

## Design note — `NaturenSearchBuilder` calls `super.constructSearchRequest()` redundantly

`NaturenSearchBuilder.java:35` calls `super.constructSearchRequest()`, which fully sets the query (with filter logic). The child then immediately re-evaluates `getFilter()` and calls `searchRequest.query(...)` again, overriding the parent's work. The parent's query setup is wasted. This works correctly because the child's assignment wins, but it's fragile — a maintainer could easily miss the override. Consider having the parent handle only infrastructure (indices, pagination, aggregations, sort) and leave query-building to each concrete class.

---

## Cleanup — `SkaSearchBuilder` / `ServiceName.SKA` appear to be unused

Verified against both test (`bgo1.test.rail.uib.no`) and production (`jambo.uib.no`) URLs: neither passes a `service=` parameter. Without it, `ServiceName.toEnum()` returns the default `MARCUS`, so `SkaSearchBuilder` is never instantiated. `ServiceName.SKA` and the related factory method `SearchBuilderFactory.skaSearch()` are also unreachable.

Options:
- **Remove** `SkaSearchBuilder`, `ServiceName.SKA`, and `SearchBuilderFactory.skaSearch()` if SKA is permanently handled by `MarcusSearchBuilder`.
- **Fix and keep** if there is any intention to use a dedicated SKA service in future (apply the filter fix from item #1 above first).
